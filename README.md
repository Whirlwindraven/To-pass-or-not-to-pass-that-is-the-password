# To pass or not to pass, that is the password 

## Description 

In this project, we had to provide functionality to a random password generator. This was done by useding functions, if statements, objects, variables, conditions, and for statements. The javascript logic then allows for users to generate a randomized password which could include uppercase alphabets, lowercase alphabets, numbers, and symbols with the restriction that the content length of the password meets the condition of being above 10 characters and beleow 120 characters.
